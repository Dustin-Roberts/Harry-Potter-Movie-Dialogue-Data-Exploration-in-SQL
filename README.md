# Harry Potter Movie Dialogue Data Exploration in SQL

For this project, I found a dataset containing all the moive dialogue for all 8 Harry Potter films. Using this data, I wanted to answer a few different questions:
* Which movie has the most lines of dialog?
* Which movie is the longest in terms of runtime?
* How have the characters with the most lines of dialogue varied across movies?
* What is the most popular location in each movie?
* Which spells are used the most across the franchise?
* Which spells are used the most across each individual movie?
* Do characters have a favorite spell?

I have written SQL queries to answer all of those questions, using JOIN, CROSS JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHILE, and WHERE

Dataset can be found at Maven Datasets: https://maven-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Harry+Potter/Harry_Potter_Movies.zip
I have also included the .csv files in this repo
